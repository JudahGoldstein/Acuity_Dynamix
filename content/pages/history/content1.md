Project DULCIMER was a highly classified NSA project that was developed in the 1970s. According to classified dossiers, it was responsible for "collecting and parsing SIGINT from across the world through satellite, aircraft and ground-based radio chatter, and cracked those numbers in huge NSA computation farms created by DARPA". The final product is The Report: an "algorithmic assessment of local “weapon assets” based on weird math". The Report is 100% accurate, but it is difficult for people to read and understand it.
