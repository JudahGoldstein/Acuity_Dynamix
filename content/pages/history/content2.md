Acuity Dynamix began contracting exclusively with the NSA, remaining in essence the high-tech research devision the team began as. By 1989 our scope expanded to working with other American agencies like the FBI and CIA to facilitate the creation of new shared information systems allowing more effective communication and information sharing between different levels of law enforcement. To today Acuity Dynamix is still the goto contractor for American law enforcement and intelligence agencies for inter-agency communication among other tech solutions.
