The NSA relied on the private sector to understand The Report's insights. Several private consultancies were founded to interpret The Report and understand its hidden meanings. In 1985, Acuity Dynamix started off as one of these private consultancies. Our specialists learned secrets that we could never unlearn, and then translated these secrets into languages that humans can understand.

Unlike our competitiors, we gained the respect and admiration of the NSA in 1989. We told them that Project DULCIMER was doomed. Project DULCIMER focused only on the capabilities of state actors, while warfare itself was increasingly becoming "decentralized and asymmetric". Eventually, The Report will become unreliable. The NSA must move beyond Project DULCIMER, and develop new ways of processing SIGINT.

As predicted, The Report's efficency degenerated. This is not to say The Report was a complete failure. Its focus on the USSR's military capabilities helped the United States win the Cold War. But that's *all* it could do. In the post-Cold War environment, The Report's infrastructure proved meaningless. Project DULCIMER was finally terminated on March 2nd 2001.

Thanks to Acuity Dynamix's perception, the NSA came up with new projects and new methods forward for dealing with national security issues. These projects were incredibly effective, for a time. But society continually changes.
