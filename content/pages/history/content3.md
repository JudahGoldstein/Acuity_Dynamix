We do not rest on our laurels. As society adapts, we adapt. It is not enough to learn how to master emerging technologies like Project DULCIMER and The Report, but to anticipate new technologies, determine how to bring them into existence, and learn when they will ultimately become obsolete. In 2005, the NSA agreed to allow us to work for "other entities", allowing us to share our tradescraft with you. Today, we're the NSA's #1 preferred vendor for the research and interpretations of emerging technologies. Hire us, and you'll find out why.
