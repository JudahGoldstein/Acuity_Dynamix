We do not rest on our laurels. As society adapts, we adapt. It is not enough to learn how to master emerging technologies like Project DULCIMER, but to anticipate new technologies, determine how to bring them into existence, and learn when they will ultimately become obsolete. After 2005 we have widiened our scope to forign and private customers, allowing us to share our tradescraft with you. Today, we are still the NSA's #1 preferred vendor for the research and interpretations of emerging technologies. Hire us, and you'll find out why.
