Safe data storage and transfer has always been the dream of professionals in SIGINT and those with information not meant for the eyes of others. Acuity Dynamix maintains the worlds largest intra-net designed from the ground up for security and anonymity, all data in VAULT is stored in nuclear safe servers with world leading security procedures to ensure even if there is a breach of protocol your data will remain safe. Data transfer occurs using our proprietary post-quantum secure encryption and data transfer protocol mixed into a stream of decoy information to ensure the utmost confidence in the privacy of the line. All data stored and transfered through Acuity Dynamix is zero knowledge, that means we not only will not know the continence of your data but also the size of said data and other metadata such as time of upload. the goal of vault is to offer a product that inspires more confidence than even storing information on physical media locally. Hard drives can be stolen, VAULT can not.
